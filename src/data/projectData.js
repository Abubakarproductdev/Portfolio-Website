      "For my Final Year Project, I built an app called SIVO. Basically, I wanted to solve a real, everyday problem: the communication gap between the deaf community and hearing people. Instead of relying on a human interpreter, I built a two-way translator that fits right in your pocket. Here is how it works: you point your phone's camera at someone using Pakistan Sign Language (PSL). The app tracks their hand and body movements, figures out what they are signing, and instantly speaks the words out loud. It also works in reverse: you can talk into the phone, and the app will translate your voice into sign language on the screen.",

      "Getting a heavy AI model to run in real-time on a mobile phone was honestly the hardest part. I built the mobile app using React Native, but I offloaded all the heavy AI processing, using tools like TensorFlow, MediaPipe, and OpenCV, to a custom Python cloud server.",
    challenges:
      "If I'm being honest, getting an AI to recognize a single, isolated sign, like 'Hello', is actually pretty straightforward. You show the model the gesture, it memorizes the hand landmarks, and you're good to go. But real life isn't a flashcard app. In the real world, people sign continuously and fluidly. When a user transitions from signing the word 'Boss' to the word 'Send,' their hands move through the air in a very unpredictable way. To a trained AI, that blurry, halfway-there hand movement looks like a completely different, random word. Instead of predicting properly, my model was initially spitting out absolute gibberish like 'Boss... Make... Apple... Send.' The noise between the signs was ruining the entire sentence.",
    MySolutions: `I spent weeks banging my head against the wall trying to fix this. I dug through dozens of academic research papers on sign language recognition, and I spent hours prompting every AI tool I could find, begging for a solution.

But almost everything I found was either too theoretical or just flat-out didn't work for a real-time mobile app.

What the AI suggested:
The AI models usually gave me standard, math-heavy computer science answers. The most common suggestion was to calculate hand speed. The logic was: if the hands slow down or stop, the person is making a sign; if the hands are moving super fast, they are just transitioning between words, so the app should ignore those frames.

Why it failed in my case: every person signs at a different speed. Some people sign incredibly fast and fluidly, while others take their time. The velocity thresholds were way too fragile.

What academic papers suggested:
A lot of researchers solved this by introducing a null or neutral sign. They trained their AI to recognize when a person's hands were resting at their sides, and forced the user to drop their hands back to a resting position between every word.

Why it failed in my case: it technically worked, but it destroyed the natural flow of Pakistan Sign Language.

Engineering my own solution:
I built a customized sliding window approach. Instead of looking at a single moment in time, I built a dynamic buffer that captures overlapping 30-frame blocks of video. The model evaluates the contextual flow of the entire movement, filtering out the transition noise naturally.

I also engineered a server-side smart matcher. If the sliding window caught messy keywords like "Boss... send... word," the server cross-references it against a database of valid, grammatically correct sentences and outputs: "Boss send project report."

By ignoring the standard hand-speed and null-sign advice and building a custom AI pipeline, I achieved a system that understands the user's intent, reaching a 95% accuracy rate without asking them to slow down.`,
